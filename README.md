# Specmatic gradle convention plugin

> **NOTE:** This plugin contains plugin conventions for building specmatic tools. This is only to be used by the
> specmatic core
> team to build tools under the `io.specmatic` namespace.

The Specmatic Gradle Plugin provides an all-in-one solution for automating obfuscation, creating shadow JARs, and
publishing artifacts to Maven repositories. By configuring the specmatic block, specmatic developers can streamline
their build process without manually handling these steps. Ideal for simplifying deployment pipelines in JVM-based
projects.

## Features

1. Auto signing/publishing of artifacts
    - maven central
    - maven local
    - specmatic private repository (on github)
    - any other supported URLs/repositories
2. License checks
    - Ensure that dependencies have a license that allows commecial use of specmatic software (i.e. no copy left
      licenses) without any incumberance.
    - Generate a license report that can be packaged in the distributable jar. This is legal requirement from licenses
      like Apache, BSD-3-Clause. These licenses have a clause that requires distributions of software to carry a notice,
      or attribution specified in the license.
3. Pretty print test progress - uses https://github.com/radarsh/gradle-test-logger-plugin
4. Publish artifacts and create GitHub releases
    - uses https://github.com/researchgate/gradle-release to create git tags
    - uses API to create a GitHub release
5. Print task info and dependencies - uses https://gitlab.com/barfuin/gradle-taskinfo
6. Print vulnerability scan reports - uses [osv-scanner](https://github.com/google/osv-scanner)
7. Creates a `version.properties` and `VersionInfo.kt` file in the `${groupId}:${projectName}` package. This contains
   details like the version number, git sha. That may be useful for `--version` or just dumping the version at startup.
8. Ensure that java and kotlin compilation is forced to a configured and consistent version across projects.
9. Ensure artifacts are reproducible.
10. Pretty print any `exec` or `javaexec` tasks, along with their outputs
11. Auto-upgrade/migrated deprecated dependencies to newer dependencies.
12. Better integration with sample repositories
    - Run a build against sample projects and validate changes.
    - Bummp version of dependency in sample project. Ensure that the appropriate jar is checked into the sample repo.
13. Conflict detection and resolution using a combination of `io.fuchs.gradle.classpath-collision-detector`,
    `org.gradlex.jvm-dependency-conflict-detection`, `org.gradlex.jvm-dependency-conflict-resolution`.
    See https://github.com/REPLicated/classpath-collision-detector
    and https://gradlex.org/jvm-dependency-conflict-resolution/ for more details.

## Requirements for using this plugin

1. The following environment variables containing secrets are needed based on the
   requirements. [This script](https://github.com/znsio/specmatic-github-workflows/blob/main/bin/upload-secrets) will
   help you upload the relevant secrets by scanning your github workflows.

                   ).firstNotNullOfOrNull { it }.toString()
               }
           }

       }
   }
   ```

3. Edit `gradle.properties` and add the plugin version
   ```properties
   specmaticGradlePluginVersion=<PLUGIN_VERSION_HERE>
   ```

4. Add the following to your `build.gradle[.kts]` file
    ```kotlin
    specmatic {
        // Set the JVM version. Currently defaults to 17
        jvmVersion = JavaLanguageVersion.of(17)
        // Set the kotlin version to be used. Currently defaults to 1.9.25
        kotlinVersion = "1.9.25"
        // Set the kotlin compiler version. Currently defaults to 1.9
        kotlinApiVersion = KotlinVersion.KOTLIN_1_9
        // List of sample projects that need validation before release, and bumping post release
        downstreamDependentProjects = listOf("project1", "project2")
   
        // replace certain dependencies with other dependencies
        versionReplacements = mapOf(
            "org.example.foo:deprecated" to "org.example.foo:shiny-thing:1.2.3"
        )    
    
        // Publish this to some repositories. Can be invoked multiple times
        publishTo("internalRepo", "https://internal.repo.url/repository/maven-releases/")
        // Publish this to maven central. Only use this on open source code
        publishToMavenCentral()
    
        // Provide license details for any libraries that don't have license information in their POM.
        // if using groovy, you may need to prefix below lines with `it.XXX` instead
        licenseData {
            name = "net.researchgate:gradle-release"
            version = "3.1.0"
            projectUrl = "https://github.com/researchgate/gradle-release"
            license = "MIT"
        }
    
        `with<Commercial|OSS><Library|Application|ApplicationLibrary>`(project(":bar")) {
            // The main class, if publishing an application variant
            mainClass = "io.specmatic.ExampleApp"
    
            // Create a GitHub release. Upload any files generated by specified tasks.
            githubRelease {
                addFile("sourcesJar", "foo-sources-${version}.jar")
            }
    
            // Create a docker build/publish task. Pass any optional args to the docker build task. 
            // The `--build-arg VERSION` is already passed as a default 
            dockerBuild("--extra", "--docker", "--args")
    
            // Obfuscation is enabled by default, but you may pass additional proguard args https://www.guardsquare.com/manual/configuration/usage
            obfuscate("-some-arg")
            obfuscate("-more-args", "-some-more-args")
    
            // Shadowing is enabled, but you pass any additional shadowing options - https://gradleup.com/shadow/
            shadow(prefix = "specmatic_foo") {
                minimize()
                // other options...
            }
    
            publish {
                // configure the pom and any other publication settings
                pom {
                    name.set("Specmatic License Validation")
                    description.set("Specmatic License parsing and validation library")
                    url.set("https://specmatic.io")
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

5. Setup your `.gitignore`
    ```gitignore
    # Add the following to the .gitignore file
    gen-kt/
    gen-resources/
    ```

6. Setup GitHub workflows. Best to copy/paste from existing workflows.

## Handling conflict resolution

To work around the dependency hell problem where multiple dependencies have the same class, but different versions, you
can use the `detectCollisions` task to detect the collisions. This will print a report of all the dependencies that have
collisions, and their versions. Additionally, this plugin wraps the `org.gradlex.jvm-dependency-conflict-resolution`
plugin that addresses conflict resolution for some [popular
dependencies](https://gradlex.org/jvm-dependency-conflict-resolution/#all-capabilities). For other dependencies, you can
use the following snippet in your project:

```kotlin
jvmDependencyConflicts {
    patch {
        // attach capabilities to multiple modules that offer the same capability
        module("org.example:old-name") {
            addCapability("org.example:some-feature")
        }

        module("org.example.somepackage:new-name") {
            addCapability("org.example:some-feature")
        }
    }

    // resolve the conflicts by selecting the highest version of the dependency
    conflictResolution {
        selectHighestVersion("org.example:some-feature")
    }
}
```

## Logging

This plugin ensures that the published application variants use slf4j and logback as the default logging mechanism.
Logback dependencies are automatically added by the plugin. A default `logback.xml` is packaged that turns off all
logging by default. In addition, you should setup your application's `main()` function to call `JULForwarder.forward()`
to setup appropriate forwarding of JUL logging to SLF4J.

```kotlin
import io.specmatic.yourpackage.JULForwarder

object Main {
    @JvmStatic
    fun main(args: Array<String>) {
        JULForwarder.forward()
        // your application code here
    }
}
```

You may override the default logback configuration by creating a `logback.xml` file and executing the application via:

```bash
java -Dlogback.configurationFile=logback.xml -jar <jar-file>
```
